# How is this different from other IAM tools? 

The aim of ```iam-dangerous-actions``` is to simplify IAM management and enhance cloud security. It helps us to achieve this by configuring and auditing IAM actions using a **risk-based** security approach.

The concept behind ```iam-dangerous-actions``` is simple yet powerful: if certain IAM actions can pose major security risks when misused, then why not exlcude them from new or existing IAM roles that don't absolutely require them in the first place?

This naturally complies with the principle of least privilege, pre-emptively reducing our AWS security risks significantly.

However, many of the IAM actions on the IAM Dangerous actions lists are necessary for valid business purposes or role-based job functions. At a minimum, these lists make us aware of the potential security risks of each IAM action.

The following [real-world use cases](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/documentations/real-world-use-cases.md) demonstrate how ```iam-dangerous-actions``` can be used to achieve these objectives.
