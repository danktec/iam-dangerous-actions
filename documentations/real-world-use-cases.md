## Security Risk Labels 
PE = Privilege Escalation                     
DC = Disabling or evasion of Security Controls     
DE = Data Exfiltration                             
HT = Hiding one's Tracks     

<br />

## Scenario 1: Quick "lock-down" of IAM Roles

For the first scenario, we will assume that a **security incident**, or **very strict time constraints** require us to quickly secure specific IAM roles in the AWS account(s). These IAM roles can belong to federated Identity Providers, permission-sets, standalone Identity-based IAM Roles, or AWS Service-roles.

- **Step 1**: 

  Let's begin by attaching the following four explicit-deny IAM policies to the problematic IAM Role(s), based on the following security risks: [PE](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/explicit-deny-PE-risk.txt), [DE](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/explicit-deny-DE-risk.txt), [DC](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/explicit-deny-DC-risk.txt) and [HT](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/explicit-deny-HT-risk.txt). This would mitigate the security risks until further steps are taken.

  **Note:** Before applying these policies, ensure you have a rollback plan and verify that critical business operations won't be disrupted. Test these policies in a non-production environment first when possible.

<br />

- **Step 2**: 

  Finally, we should deploy new SCPs (Service Control Policies) to safeguard these customer-managed, explicit-deny IAM policies against unauthorized access by anyone except security and cloud administrators. This prevents malicious actors from detaching or modifying the protective policies.

<br />

## Scenario 2: Finding all dangerous IAM Roles in the AWS account

This is a very common use case: to identify **all existing** IAM Roles that could pose a security threat (contain dangerous IAM actions) if abused by malicious users, whether internal or external. The same concept applies to legitimate users who performed damaging operations accidentally.

As we progress through the demo, each IAM role will automatically contain **all of the IAM actions** included in its identity or inline policies. Additionally, any explicit deny actions included in any IAM role's policies will be automatically **excluded** from the results. 

- **Step 1**:

  To avoid conflicts with existing installed packages, it is strongly recommended to run this demo in a new Docker container (or Virtual Machine). The steps include everything required to make things work on a base OS.
  
  The demo has been tested and confirmed to work on Ubuntu Linux. Special instructions are included for macOS users accordingly.

  First, we will install and run [iam-collect](https://github.com/cloud-copilot/iam-collect) in order to retrieve the AWS IAM data locally, as well as [iam-lens](https://github.com/cloud-copilot/iam-lens), which the script in Step 2 below will use. We will also install Python, Node, and other necessary packages:  
  

  ```bash
  cd ~ && mkdir iam-demo1 && cd iam-demo1  

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y python3 jq git curl unzip  


  ## Removing existing apt-installed nodejs versions and installing v22.18.0 through nvm to avoid conflicts: 
  sudo apt purge nodejs npm
  sudo apt autoremove
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
  source ~/.bashrc 
  nvm install v22.18.0
  source ~/.bashrc && npm install -g npm@11.5.2


  ## Installing the AWS CLI 
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" 
  unzip awscliv2.zip && cd aws && sudo ./install && cd ~/iam-demo1


  ## Optional: verify AWS CLI installation
  aws --version


  ## Running AWS Configure 
  aws configure 
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: (press enter to leave empty)
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: (press enter to leave empty)
    Default region name [None]: us-east-1   
    Default output format [None]: json
  

  ## Export AWS credentials (replace with your actual credentials)
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
  export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-session-token"


  ## Optional: validate AWS credentials
  aws sts get-caller-identity


  ## Install and configure iam-lens & iam-collect: 
  npm install -g @cloud-copilot/iam-collect
  iam-collect init
  iam-collect download --services iam
  npm install -g @cloud-copilot/iam-lens
  ```  
<br />

- **Step 2**:

   The next step is to run the following [shell script](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/scripts/all-actions-for-all-roles.sh), kindly provided by [David Kerber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidkerber/). The script will create **one** .txt file for **every** IAM role that exists in the AWS account. Each .txt file will therefore represent an IAM role and include **all of its combined IAM actions** (for both inline and identity-based policies). The script's output is stored in a new ```results``` folder.

  ```bash
  cd ~/iam-demo1

  git clone https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/
  
  ## For macOS users, copy "all-actions-for-all-roles-mac.sh" instead of "all-actions-for-all-roles.sh":  
  cp iam-dangerous-actions/scripts/all-actions-for-all-roles.sh . 


  ## For macOS users, it would be: sh all-actions-for-all-roles-mac.sh
  sh all-actions-for-all-roles.sh 
  ``` 

  Here is a sample terminal output of ```all-actions-for-all-roles.sh```: 
  ```bash
  Processed arn:aws:iam::111222333444:role/service-role/ABC -> results/arn_aws_iam__111222333444_role_service-role_ABC.txt
  Processed arn:aws:iam::111222333444:role/DEF -> results/arn_aws_iam__111222333444_role_DEF.txt
 
  All actions for roles have been processed. Check the results directory.
  ```
<br />

 - **Step 3**:

   Lastly, using this AI-generated [python script](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/scripts/IAM_cross_checker_MP.py), we can now cross-check any of the available ```iam-dangerous-actions``` [lists](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/tree/main/lists) against the ```results``` folder, which contains all of the IAM Role files, and their respective permissions. For this example, we will use the ```iam-actions-HT-risk.txt``` list. 

   **Side-note:** Using any of the ```iam-dangerous-actions``` lists which **have** security risks assigned to their IAM actions, will save a significant amount of effort later on compared to choosing the [iam-dangerous-actions.txt](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-dangerous-actions.txt) that has **no** security risks assigned. This is because the output of the script below will automatically include the IAM actions **and their respective security risks**, rather than this having to be done manually.

   <br />

   
   ```
   cd ~/iam-demo1
  
   cp iam-dangerous-actions/scripts/IAM_cross_checker_MP.py .
    
   cp iam-dangerous-actions/lists/iam-actions-HT-risk.txt .   
  
   python3 IAM_cross_checker_MP.py iam-actions-HT-risk.txt results output-all-dangerous-roles.txt 
   ```
  
   Sample terminal output of IAM_cross_checker_MP.py: 

   ```
   Loaded 56 actions from iam-actions-HT-risk.txt
   Processing IAM Role: arn_aws_iam__111222333444_role_ABC
   ... ... 
   Processing IAM Role: arn_aws_iam__111222333444_role_DEF
   Report generated: output-all-dangerous-roles.txt
   Roles processed: 125
   Roles with matching dangerous-iam-actions: 44
   ```
 
   Sample file output of output-all-dangerous-roles.txt:

   ``` 
   Role: arn_aws_iam__111222333444_role_Beanstalk-EC2-Role
   "s3:PutObject": HT
   --------------------------------------------------
   Role: arn_aws_iam__111222333444_role_Lambda
   "s3:DeleteObject": HT
   "s3:PutObject": HT
   ...  
   ```
   The output file, ```output-all-dangerous-roles.txt```, contains the ```iam-dangerous-actions``` found across all of the IAM Roles in the account. Happy auditing!


<br />

 - **Step 4**:

   Cleaning up iam-demo1: 

    ```bash
    cd ~ && rm -rf ~/iam-demo1
    ```

<br />

## Scenario 3: Checking which IAM policies are "dangerous" 

In Scenario 3, we will check if **newly created** or **existing** IAM policies contain any dangerous IAM actions. We will use an AI-generated [python script](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/scripts/IAM_cross_checker_SP.py), which will identify the presence of ```iam-dangerous-actions``` across any IAM policy we would like to audit.  


- **Step 1**: 

    To avoid conflicts with existing installed packages, it is strongly recommended to run this demo in a new Docker container (or Virtual Machine). The steps include everything required to make things work on a base OS.

    First, let's gather **all** the customer-managed IAM policies in the account using [iam-collect](https://github.com/cloud-copilot/iam-collect), so they are available locally. We will also install Python, Node v20.0+, and other necessary packages:  


    ```bash
    cd ~ && mkdir iam-demo2 && cd iam-demo2  

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3 jq git curl unzip  


    ## Removing existing apt-installed nodejs versions and installing v22.18.0 through nvm to avoid conflicts: 
    sudo apt purge nodejs npm
    sudo apt autoremove
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.bashrc 
    nvm install v22.18.0
    source ~/.bashrc && npm install -g npm@11.5.2


    ## Installing the AWS CLI
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" 
    unzip awscliv2.zip && cd aws && sudo ./install && cd ~/iam-demo2


    ## Optional: verify AWS CLI installation
    aws --version


    ## Running aws configure: 
    aws configure 
      AWS Access Key ID [None]: (press enter to leave empty)
      AWS Secret Access Key [None]: (press enter to leave empty)
      Default region name [None]: us-east-1   
      Default output format [None]: json


    ## Export AWS credentials (replace with your actual credentials)
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
    export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-session-token"  # Only needed for temporary credentials


    ## Optional: validate AWS connectivity
    aws sts get-caller-identity


    ## Install and configure iam-collect: 
    npm install -g @cloud-copilot/iam-collect
    iam-collect init
    iam-collect download --services iam
    ```
  <br />

- **Step 2**: 

    Next, we can choose any of the ```iam-dangerous-actions``` security-risk lists to use: [all-security-risks](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-actions-DE-risk.txt), [PE](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-actions-PE-risk.txt), [DC](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-actions-DC-risk.txt), [DE](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-actions-DE-risk.txt) or [HT](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-actions-HT-risk.txt). 
    
    In this example, we will use the [list](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/lists/iam-actions-all-risks.txt) ```iam-actions-all-risks.txt```, which includes **all** the IAM actions and their respective security risks. 

    ```bash
     cd ~/iam-demo2

     git clone https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/ && cd iam-dangerous-actions/scripts 
     
     cp ~/iam-demo2/iam-dangerous-actions/lists/iam-actions-all-risks.txt .
   
    ```
  <br />

- **Step 3**: 

  Now we can choose any IAM policy we would like to audit against our ```iam-actions-all-risks.txt``` list, and copy it over to our working directory: 
  
  ```bash
  ## Make sure to change the AWS account number and specific IAM policy names accordingly:  
  cp ~/iam-demo2/iam-data/aws/aws/accounts/111222333444/iam/policy/<iam_policy_name_lower_case>/current_policy.json ~/iam-demo2/iam-dangerous-actions/scripts/<iam_policy_name_in_lower_case>.json

  ``` 
  For this demo, the ```dangerous_iam_policy.json``` sample IAM policy **already** exists in the scripts folder. It has the following permissions:

    ```bash
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "SampleDangerousIAMPolicyDoNotUseInProduction",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "iam:*",
                    "lambda:CreateFunction",
                    "sts:AssumeRole",
                    "cloudfront:ListConflictingAliases",
                    "cloudfront:ListAnycastIpLists",
                    "cloudfront:ListDistributions",
                    "s3:*",
                    "ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes",
                    "ec2:DescribeAddresses",
                    "ec2:DescribeImportSnapshotTasks"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

  Notice how `iam:*`, `s3:*`, and `sts:AssumeRole` coexist with other, less harmful IAM actions, such as `ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes`. 
  
  <br />

- **Step 4**: 

  Finally, we can now run this [Python script](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/blob/main/scripts/IAM_cross_checker_SP.py), which will check if there are any ```iam-dangerous-actions``` that also exist in the IAM policy ```dangerous-iam-policy.json```. Let's see it in action:  

    ```bash
    cd ~/iam-demo2/iam-dangerous-actions/scripts/

    ## Option 1: We can run the script against the sample IAM policy named dangerous-iam-policy.json which already exists in the scripts folder:  
    python3 IAM_cross_checker_SP.py iam-actions-all-risks.txt dangerous-iam-policy.json 
    

    ## OR, option 2: run the script and point it directly to an IAM policy as part of the iam-data folder created by iam-collect in Step 1. 
    ## Don't forget to change the account number and IAM policy name accordingly:  
    python3 IAM_cross_checker_SP.py iam-actions-all-risks.txt ~/iam-demo2/iam-data/aws/aws/accounts/111222333444/iam/policy/<iam_policy_name_in_lower_case>/current_policy.json
    ```

    The script automatically handles IAM actions with wildcards in the IAM policy, and saves the results to a file named ```matched_permissions_SP.txt```. Here is a sample terminal output: 

  ```bash
  ============================================================
  AWS Permission Checker (Enhanced)
  ============================================================

  🔍 Loaded 401 permissions:
   1. "sts:AssumeRole": PE, (DC, DE, HT)
   2. "sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML": PE, (DC, DE, HT)
   3. "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity": PE, (DC, DE, HT)
  ... and 398 more

  📜 Policy patterns:

   2. lambda:createfunction
   3. sts:assumerole
   4. cloudfront:listconflictingaliases
   5. cloudfront:listanycastiplists
   6. cloudfront:listdistributions
   7. s3:*

  ✅ "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile": (PE, DC)
  ✅ "iam:AddUserToGroup": PE
  ... and 129 more 
  ============================================================

  💾 Saved 132 matched permissions to: matched_permissions_SP.txt
  ```

  As we can see, our IAM policy includes 132 **potentially** dangerous IAM actions, where each IAM action has the appropriate security risk(s) assigned to it. Alternatively, we can also use the `iam-dangerous-actions.txt` list if we need to have output of IAM Actions and no security risks assigned.  

  <br />

  **Step 5**:

  Now we can carefully review the results to determine the necessity or potential removal of these IAM actions. After the analysis is complete, clean up the demo environment:

    ```bash
    cd ~ && rm -rf ~/iam-demo2
    ```


  <br />

  **Important notes and considerations**:

  1. **AWS Services Coverage Limitations**: Not all AWS services in a given IAM policy will fall under the currently supported [list of services](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/tree/main/supporting-files/current_services.txt) for ```iam-dangerous-actions```. Due to the vast size of the AWS universe with over 300 services, many AWS services will **not** be included in the future as part of ```iam-dangerous-actions```.

  2) In the dangerous sample IAM policy above (do not use in production!), EC2 was part of the IAM policy, but it is not **yet** part of ```iam-dangerous-actions```.  This reflects the reality that an IAM policy will more than likely include AWS services that are not yet part of ```iam-dangerous-actions```, and that they may or may not be included in the future.  

     In other words, there could be IAM actions under EC2 that are actually dangerous, but would not be flagged as such today. However, in this specific example, the three EC2 actions in the dangerous sample IAM policy are `describe` in nature and would not be included in the `iam-dangerous-actions` lists, even when the EC2 service is added in the near future.

  3. **Future AWS Services Additions**: The current list of planned AWS services to be added can be found [here](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Services-to-add%22). This [ReadMe section](https://github.com/ZiyadAlmbasher/iam-dangerous-actions?tab=readme-ov-file#List-of-current-AWS-services) explains which AWS services are currently included in ```iam-dangerous-actions``` and how other services are chosen.
